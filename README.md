# racer-highway
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/racer-highway.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/racer-highway/)

Transport plugin for [Racer](https://github.com/codeparty/racer). It uses pure `websockets` and fallbacks to `browserchannel` in the case of old browsers and proxy errors. If you only need to use `websockets` try [racer-ws](https://github.com/derbyparty/racer-ws).

## Note

 * Since version 7.0.0 racer-highway supports only racer >= 0.8
 * Since version 8.0.0 racer-highway supports only racer >= 0.9

## Usage

In the server part of your app:

```js
var highway = require('racer-highway'); 

// ...
// var server = http.createServer
// ...

// ...
// var store  = racer.createStore 
// or
// var store  = derby.createStore
// ...

var handlers = highway(store);

expressApp = express();

// ...

expressApp.use(cookieParser());
expressApp.use(session());

// ...

expressApp.use(handlers.middleware);


server.on('upgrade', handlers.upgrade);
```

Connect session support in hooks:
```
var serverOptions = {
  session: session()
}
var handlers = racerHighWay(store, serverOptions);
```

## Browserify

Racer Highway will bundle the client browser script using Browserify in the
call to `store.bundle(...)`, as illustrated in the
[racer-examples](https://github.com/derbyjs/racer-examples).  However, if you
want to do this ahead of time, you can add this to your gulp browserify task
using something like:

```js
var browserify = require('browserify');
var racerClientBundle = require('racer-highway/lib/bundle');

// ...

bundler = browserify(opts);
// this adds the racer-highway/lib/browser.js to our bundle
(racerClientBundle())(bundler);
```

## Client Options

A client options object can be passed to `racerClientBundle(clientOptions)`
to override some aspects of the default behaviour.

In addition, there is a `racer.overrideClientOptions(overrideOptions)` method
that can be called on the client before `racer.createModel(data)` to provide
extra, dynamic, customisation post-bundling.

This can be used in the client browser code to, for example, force the use of
browser channel (for testing) or pass an extraParams object:

```js
racer.overrideClientOptions({
  browserChannelOnly: true,
  extraParams: {
    ticket: "<authentication-ticket>"
  }
})
```

`extraParams` holds name-value pairs that will get added to the query string
of the websocket connection request and each browser channel request and can
be useful for implementing ticket based (non-cookie) session authentication.
